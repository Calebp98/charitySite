<h2 id="co-founder-for-good-policies"><strong>Co-founder for Good Policies</strong></h2>

<h2 id="the-position"><strong>The position</strong></h2>

<p>I am seeking out an altruistic and driven co-founder who is keen to maximise their counterfactual impact by starting high impact charities. I have decided to found a charity with a current focus on tobacco control, advocating to low and middle-income countries to increase tobacco taxes. The <a href="https://www.who.int/tobacco/mpower/raise_taxes/en/">World Health Organization</a> and <a href="https://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/publication/chronic-disease">Copenhagen Consensus, state</a> that this is the amongst the most cost-effective policies that they are aware of in global health and you can read a summary of Charity Entrepreneurshipâ€™s research on tobacco taxation <a href="http://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/blog/tobacco-taxation">here</a> and GiveWellâ€™s conversation notes where they discuss tobacco taxation <a href="https://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Yolonda_Richardson_12-12-17_(public).pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>Our research and cost effectiveness analysis suggests that this is likely to be the most cost-effective policy that has been rigorously examined that mitigates the disease burden of non-communicable diseases. The organisation is amenable to other interventions if a strong case can be made that they are likely to be more cost-effective.</p>
